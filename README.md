Hi! I’m a full‑stack developer passionate about building practical and meaningful web applications.  
Here's a featured project I developed as part of a team during an intensive bootcamp:

- 🌐 **Live Demo**: [Try SheTravel](https://github.com/CampusDual/demos/tree/main/public/2023-BFS-3-G4_sheTravel)

**SheTravel** is a web application that helps women plan safer and more empowering travel experiences.
