Hi! I’m a full‑stack developer passionate about building practical and meaningful web applications.  
Here are some projects I developed:

## 🗺️ MappedIn — Simple Area-Based Job Search Tool

- 📂 **Repository**: [MappedIn · GitHub](https://github.com/BraisAM/MappedIn)  
- 🌐 **Live Demo**: [Try MappedIn](https://braisam.github.io/MappedIn)

**MappedIn** is a lightweight web app that lets you draw a custom area on a map, detect the towns inside, and generate LinkedIn job search links for each one.  
It was built as a small side project to test a useful idea while passing the time — not actively maintained, but it works!
